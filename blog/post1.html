                <h1><i>My Morning Routine.</i></h1>
                <p>My morning routine is not that special. I wake up roughly around
                    3:15AM and leave my house at 3:30AM. Then I hitch a ride with my dad
                    when he goes to work at 5AM. Afterwards, I take the car or the bus 
                    to go to Scott Road Park and Ride, if I have the car, or I go straight to 
                    Surrey Central, if I take the bus. I try to arrive on campus around 7:30-7:40AM
                    so I have time to revise, review, or work on some assignments for a class. But before I
                    go inside the Campus, I actually order myself some coffee from the nearby Tim Hortons,
                    so I can be energized and it helps keep me awake.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    That is roughly my morning routine, since after having classes, I just find 
                    a way home, but that's a story to be told some other day. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Also to note, my morning routine during weekdays and weekends are somewhat different.
                    However, the only difference is that during weekends, I get to sleep a few hours in
                    and I can drink as much coffee as I want.
