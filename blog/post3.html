                <h1><i>My Science Experiment.</i></h1>
                <p>As you can see me picking up the specimen, science can be very dangerous.
                    At that time I didn't really know what it was and I was just curious, 
                    so I researched it myself. But the thing is, I wasn't prepared at all for
                    that little jump on my face. It was terrifying to say the least.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    However, this was all preventable if I had the proper procedures in handling
                    this specimen. There was no cover to the plate, and I wasn't wearing any 
                    special protection in case something happened. I also should have someone with me 
                    or have some type of way to contact someone if this ever happened. Lesson learned,
                    have safety gear.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Anyways, I am lucky to survive, and I'll take this chance to instill some 
                    safety procedures and gear for our lab. I will also have to report to the higher
                    ups, about the danger of this specimen, and if we could do further testing 
                    if possible.
