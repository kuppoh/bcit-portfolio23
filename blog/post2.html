                <h1><i>My Fantasy Adventures.</i></h1>
                <p>Unfortunately, most of my fantasy adventures are through imagination,
                    however, I must admit that I always had thoughts of wanting to experience 
                    something like it. I always have the weirdest, craziest, and most 
                    adventurous imaginations, so much so, that I even started to write
                    some of these things down to better remember them.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The reason why I have such imaginations are due to various influences.
                    I have watched the LOTR Trilogy so many times, its a wonder how I have not 
                    yet to become tired of watching them. You can definitely say, I am a LOTR fanatic.
                    Another reason is D&D, it may sound nerdy, but the endless possiblities
                    that you can create and imagine is truly fantastic.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Lately, however, I am experiencing less and less of such imaginations.
                    Most likely due to the fact that I have resumed my schooling. To get around that,
                    I found watching D&D roleplaying channels, like Dimension20 or Critical Role. I even
                    resorted to watching some fantasy movies and series, and you can bet I watched LOTR many times.
                    Anyways, its always good to take a step out of reality and relax for a bit, just
                    to ease our minds off from any stressors and have a little time for ourselves, besides,
                    it doesn't hurt to do so.
